0.  How many different colors does each format support?

and 48-bit deep color - over a billion colors
BMP - can support up to 2^32 colors, however, the standart color palette is 24-bit.

1.  Which of the formats supports animation?
GIF
2.  What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
With lossless compression every single bit of data that was originally in
the file remains after the file is uncompressed. Lossy compression
reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information (especially
redundant information). When the file is uncompressed, only part
of the original information is there.

3.  Which of theres formats is lossy-compressed?
JPEG
4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on
a FAT file system?
The file information remains on the hard disk and only the metadata
pointing to the file is rewritten.
5.  What can someone like you do to ensure(with high probability) that
files you delete cannot be recovered?
I can overwrite the data with other data, for example, I can fill
all the addresses with ASCII NUL bytes.
